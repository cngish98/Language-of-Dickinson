        Frequently the woods are pink - 
        Frequently, are brown. 
        Frequently the hills undress 
        Behind my native town - 
        Oft a head is crested 
        I was wont to see - 
        And as oft a cran n y 
        Where it used to be - 
        And the Earth - they tell me 
        On it's axis turned! 
        Wonderful 
        By but twelve performed! 
    </body>
