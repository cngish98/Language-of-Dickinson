<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW 

 A Wounded Deer - leaps highest - 
        I've heard the Hunter tell - 
        'Tis but the Extasy of death - 
        And then the Brake is still! 
        
        The Smitten Rock that gushes! 
        The trampled Steel that springs! 
        A Cheek is always redder 
        Just where the Hectic stings! 
        
        Mirth is the Mail of Anguish - 
        In which it Cautious Arm, 
        Lest anybody spy the blood 
        And "you're hurt" exclaim!
