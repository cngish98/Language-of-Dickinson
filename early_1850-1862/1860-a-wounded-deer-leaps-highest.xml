        A Wounded Deer -- leaps highest -- 
        I've heard the Hunter tell -- 
        'Tis but the Extasy of death -- 
        And then the Brake is still! 
        
        The Smitten Rock that gushes! 
        The trampled Steel that springs! 
        A Cheek is always redder 
        Just where the Hectic stings! 
        
        Mirth is the Mail of Anguish -- 
        In which it Cautious Arm, 
        Lest anybody spy the blood 
        And "you're hurt" exclaim! 
    </body>
