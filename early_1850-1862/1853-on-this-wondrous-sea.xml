        On this wondrous sea - sailing silently - 
        Ho! Pilot! Ho! 
        Knowest thou the shore 
        Where no breakers roar - 
        Where the storm is o'er? 
        
        In the silent West 
        Many - the sails at rest - 
        The anchors fast. 
        Thither I pilot thee - 
        Land! Ho! Eternity! 
        Ashore at last! 
    </body>
