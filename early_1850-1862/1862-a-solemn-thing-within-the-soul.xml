        A Solemn thing within the Soul 
        To feel itself get ripe -- 
        And golden hang -- while farther up -- 
        The Maker's Ladders stop -- 
        And in the Orchard far below -- 
        You hear a Being -- drop -- 
        
        A Wonderful -- to feel the 
        Sun Still toiling at the Cheek 
        You thought was finished -- 
        Cool of eye, and critical of Work -- 
        He shifts the stem -- a little -- 
        To give your Gore -- a look -- 
        
        But solemnest -- to know 
        Your chance in Harvest moves 
        A little nearer -- Every Sun 
        The Single -- to some lives.
