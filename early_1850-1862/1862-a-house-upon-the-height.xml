        A House upon the Hight -- 
        That Wagon never reached -- 
        No Dead, were ever carried down -- 
        No Peddler's Cart -- approached -- 
        
        Whose Chimney never smoked -- 
        Whose Windows -- Night and Morn -- 
        Caught Sunrise first -- and Sunset -- last -- 
        Then -- held an Empty Pane -- 
        
        Whose fate -- Conjecture knew -- 
        No other neighbor -- did -- 
        And what it was -- we never lisped -- 
        Because He -- never told -- 
    </body>
