<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW 

Adrift! A little boat adrift! 
And night is coming down! 
Will no one guide a little boat 
Unto the nearest town? 

So sailors say - on yesterday - 
Just as the dusk was brown 
One little boat gave up it's strife 
And gurgled down and down. 

So angels say - on yesterday - 
Just as the dawn was red 
One little boat - o'erspent with gales - 
Retrimmed it's masts - redecked it's sails - 
And shot - exultant on!
