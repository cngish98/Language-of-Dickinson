        Adrift! A little boat adrift! 
        And night is coming down! 
        Will no one guide a little boat 
        Unto the nearest town? 
        
        So sailors say - on yesterday - 
        Just as the dusk was brown 
        One little boat gave up it's strife 
        And gurgled down and down. 
        
        So angels say - on yesterday - 
        Just as the dawn was red 
        One little boat - o'erspent with gales - 
        Retrimmed it's masts - redecked it's sails - 
        And shot - exultant on!
