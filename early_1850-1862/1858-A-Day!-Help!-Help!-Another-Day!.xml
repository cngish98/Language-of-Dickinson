        A Day! Help! Help! Another Day! 
        Your prayers, oh Passer by! 
        From such a common ball as this 
        Might date a Victory! 
        From marshallings as simple 
        The flags of nations swang. 
        Steady -- my soul: What issues 
        Upon thine arrow hang! 
    </body>
