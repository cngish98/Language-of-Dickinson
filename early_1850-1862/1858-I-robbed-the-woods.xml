        I robbed the Woods 
        The trusting Woods. 
        The unsuspecting Trees 
        Brought out their 
        Burs and mosses 
        My fantasy to please. 
        I scanned their trinkets curious -- 
        I grasped -- I bore away -- 
        What will the solemn Hemlock -- 
        What will the Oak tree say?
