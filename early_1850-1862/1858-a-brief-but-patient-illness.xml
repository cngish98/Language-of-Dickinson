<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW 

A brief, but patient illness - 
        An hour to prepare - 
        And one below, this morning 
        Is where the angels are - 
        It was a short procession - 
        The Bobolink was there - 
        An aged Bee addressed us - 
        And then we knelt in prayer - 
        We trust that she was willing - 
        We ask that we may be - 
        Summer - Sister - Seraph! 
        Let us go with thee!
