        A feather from the Whippowil 
        That everlasting -- sings! 
        Whose galleries -- are Sunrise -- 
        Whose Opera -- the Springs -- 
        Whose Emerald Nest the Ages spin 
        Of mellow -- murmuring thread -- 
        Whose Beryl Egg, what School Boys hunt 
        In "Recess" -- Overhead! 
    </body>
