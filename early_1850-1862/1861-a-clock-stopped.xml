        A Clock stopped -- 
        Not the Mantel's -- 
        Geneva's farthest skill 
        Cant put the puppet bowing -- 
        That just now dangled still -- 
        
        An awe came on the Trinket! 
        The Figures hunched, With pain -- 
        Then quivered out of Decimals -- 
        Into Degreeless Noon -- 
        
        It will not stir for Doctor's -- 
        This Pendulum of snow -- 
        The Shopman importunes it -- 
        While cool -- concernless No -- 
        
        stares Nods from the Gilded pointers -- 
        Nods from the Seconds slim -- 
        Decades of Arrogance between 
        The Dial life -- 
        And Him -- 
        
    </body>
