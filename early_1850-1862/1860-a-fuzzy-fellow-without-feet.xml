        A fuzzy fellow, without feet - 
        Yet doth exceeding run! 
        Of velvet, is his Countenance - 
        And his complexion, dun! 
        
        Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass! 
        Sometime, opon a bough, 
        From which he doth descend in plush 
        Opon the Passer-by! 
        
        All this in summer - 
        But when winds alarm the Forest Folk, 
        He taketh Damask Residence - 
        And struts in s e wing silk! 
        
        Then, finer than a Lady, 
        Emerges in the spring! 
        A Feather on each shoulder! 
        You'd scarce recognize him!
        
        
        By men, yclept Caterpillar! 
        By me! But who am I, 
        To tell the pretty secret 
        Of the Butterfly!
