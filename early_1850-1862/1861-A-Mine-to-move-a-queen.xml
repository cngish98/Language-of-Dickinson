<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW 
A Mien to move a Queen - 
Half Child - Half Heroine - 
An Orleans in the eye 
That puts it's manner by 
For humbler Company 
When none are near 
Even a Tear - 
It's frequent Visitor - 

A Bonnet like a Duke - 
And yet a Wren's Peruke 
Were not so shy 
Of Goer by - 
And Hands - so slight, 
They would elate a sprite 
With merriment - 

A Voice that alters - Low 
And on the ear can go 
Like Let of Snow - 
Or shift supreme - 
As tone of Realm 
On Subjects Diadem -

Too small - to fear - 
Too distant - to endear - 
And so Men Compromise - 
And Men - too Brigadier - And just - revere -
