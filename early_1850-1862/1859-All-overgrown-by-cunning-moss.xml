        All overgrown by cunning moss, 
        All interspersed with weed, 
        The little cage of "Currer Bell" 
        In quiet "Haworth" laid. 
        
        This Bird -- observing others 
        When frosts too sharp became 
        Retire to other latitudes -- 
        Quietly did the same -- 
        
        But differed in returning -- 
        Since Yorkshire hills are green -- 
        Yet not in all the nests I meet -- 
        Can Nightingale be seen -- 
        
        Or -- 
        
        Gathered from many wanderings -- 
        Gethsemane can tell 
        Thro' what transporting anguish 
        She reached the Asphodel! 
        
        Soft fall the sounds of Eden 
        Upon her puzzled ear -- 
        Oh what an afternoon for Heaven, 
        When "Bronte" entered there!
