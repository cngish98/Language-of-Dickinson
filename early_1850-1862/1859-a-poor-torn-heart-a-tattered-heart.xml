        A poor -- torn heart -- a tattered heart -- 
        That sat it down to rest -- 
        Nor noticed that the 
        Ebbing Day Flowed silver to the West 
        Nor noticed Night did soft descend -- 
        Nor Constellation burn -- 
        Intent upon the vision 
        Of latitudes unknown. 
        
        The angels -- happening that way 
        This dusty heart espied -- 
        Tenderly took it up from toil 
        And carried it to God 
        There -- sandals for the Barefoot -- 
        There -- gathered from the gales -- 
        Do the blue havens by the hand 
        Lead the wandering Sails. 
    </body>
