<!--Because of the elision / ambiguity in this poem I was having a hard time understanding what is happening, but I think 
    I understand a general theme of desire/wealth -->

<!-- 
Themself are all I have -
Myself a freckled - be -
I thought you'd choose a Velvet Cheek
Or one of Ivory -
Would you - instead of Me?
