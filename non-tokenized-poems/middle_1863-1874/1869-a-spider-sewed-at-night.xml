<!--I have seen multiple interpretations of this poem suggesting it is both an extended metaphor for God, or for writing, or both. 
    Also that T.W. Higginson himself might be the "himself" mentioned in the second stanza. I am not sure, there are multiple ways
    to look at it. Let me know what you think because this poem was particularly difficult. -->

<!-- 
A Spider sewed at Night
Without a Light
Upon an Arc of White.

If Ruff it was of Dame
Or Shroud of Gnome Himself himself inform.

Of Immortality
His Strategy
Was Physiognomy.
