<!--Didn't find any other interpretations of this poem, so I believe it's about how people are so engrossed in their own
    social norms and rituals that they are slow to recognize their own minds / consciousnesses. Feel 
    free to add onto my ideas though. -->

<!-- 
Like Men and Women Shadows walk
Upon the Hills Today -
With here and there a mighty Bow
Or trailing Courtesy
To Neighbors doubtless of their own
Not quickened to perceive
Minuter landscape as Ourselves
And Boroughs where we live -
