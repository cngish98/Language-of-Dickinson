<!--Couldn't find any other interpretations of this poem, so my idea is that she is criticizing
    those who labor for wealth but then hoard what they earn. Not sure how accurate this is though. -->

<!-- 
A Mine there is
no Man would own
But must it be
conferred,
Demeaning by
exclusive wealth
A Universe beside -

Potosi never to
be spent
But hoarded in
the mind

What Misers
wring their
hands tonight
For Indies in
the Ground!
