<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW -->
<!-- 
    Escape is such a thankful Word
    I often in the Night
    Consider it unto myself
    No  Monster spectacle in sight
    
    Escape - it is the Basket
    In which the Heart is caught
    When down some awful Battlement
    The rest of Life is dropt -
    
    'Tis not to sight the savior -
    It is to be the saved -
    And that is why I lay my Head
    Upon this trusty word 
    - -->
