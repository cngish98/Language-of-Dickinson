# Language-of-Dickinson
This project aims to explore innovative linguistic features of Emily Dickinson's poetry. We will mainly track her the types of ellipsis and imagery that are most commonplace in her poems, and how ellipsis correlates with other factors, such as date written, recipients, and imagery.
