<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW -->
<!--     
    So give me back to Death -
    The Death I never feared
    Except that it deprived of thee -
    And now, by Life deprived,
    In my own Grave I breathe
    And estimate it's size -
    It's size is all that Hell can guess -
    And all that Heaven surmise/was - 
-->
