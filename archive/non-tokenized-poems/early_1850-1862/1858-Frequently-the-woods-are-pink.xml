<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW 
Frequently the woods are pink - 
Frequently, are brown. 
Frequently the hills undress 
Behind my native town - 
Oft a head is crested 
I was wont to see - 
And as oft a cran n y 
Where it used to be - 
And the Earth - they tell me 
On it's axis turned! 
Wonderful 
By but twelve performed! 
-->
