<!--Also a kind of vague poem that I didn't find interpretations for: I am guessing that she wants to savor time 
    before it meets its end at the "gallows." There could possibly be more you can go into with this, for sure-->
    
<!-- 
Oh Sumptuous moment
Slower go
 Till That I  can may gloat on thee -
'Twill never be the same to starve
 Since Now  that I abundance see -

Which was to famish, then or now -
The difference of Day
 to Ask him unto the Gallows  called led -
 By With morning in the sky
