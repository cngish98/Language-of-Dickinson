                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                <p>This project analyzes linguistic ellipsis (elision) present in 90 poems written
                    by Emily Dickinson. More specifically, we sought to analyze the correlation
                    between elision and other factors, such as imagery, themes, recipients, and the
                    time period in which the poems were written.</p>

                <p><strong>Our main research questions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What types of ellipsis and imagery are most commonplace in Dickinson's poems?</li>
                    <li>How does ellipsis correlate with other factors associated with her
                        poems, such as date written, recipients, and imagery?</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Through our markup and analysis of these poems using XML-based technologies, we
                    were able to generate some answers to these questions and even some new ideas.
