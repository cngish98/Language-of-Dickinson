                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                <p>This project analyzes linguistic ellipsis (elision) present in 90 poems written
                    by Emily Dickinson. More specifically, we sought to analyze the correlation
                    between elision and other factors, such as imagery, themes, recipients, and the
                    time period in which the poems were written.</p>

                <p><strong>Our main research questions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What types of ellipsis and imagery are most commonplace in Dickinson's work?</li>
                    <li>What syntactic and semantic implications are contained in her use of
                        ellipsis? </li>
                    <li>How does ellipsis correlate with other factors associated with her
                        poems, such as recipients or imagery?</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Through our markup and analysis of these poems using XML-based technologies, we
                    were able to generate some answers to these questions, and even some new ideas.

                <p>We developed this project in Spring 2021 for the Computational Methods in the
                    Digital Humanities course at the University of Pittsburgh. The project
                    contributors consist of Caroline Gish, Wyatt Nicholas, and Rachel Wonder.
                    Special thanks to our mentor Charlie Taylor and professor David Birnbaum for
                    their guidance throughout the course of our project. </p>
