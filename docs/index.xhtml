                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                <p>This project analyzes linguistic ellipsis (elision) present in 90 poems written by Emily Dickinson. 
                    More specifically, we sought to analyze the correlation between elision and other factors, such
                    as imagery, themes, recipients, and the time period in which the poems were written.</p>
                
                <p>What syntactic and semantic implications are contained in Dickinson's use of ellipsis? 
                    Does she tend to use it more or less when writing about a certain topic? Or to a certain person?
                    Through our markup and analysis of these poems using XML-based technologies, we were able to generate some
                    answers to these questions, and even some new ideas. Explore our website to find out more!</p>

                <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
                <p>We developed this project in Spring 2021 for the Computational Methods in the Digital Humanities course 
                    at the University of Pittsburgh.  The project contributors consist of 
                    Caroline Gish, Wyatt Nicholas, and Rachel Wonder. Special thanks to our mentor 
                    Charlie Taylor and professor David Birnbaum for their guidance throughout the 
                    course of our project.
