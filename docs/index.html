            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                <p>This project analyzes linguistic ellipsis (elision) present in 90 poems written by Emily Dickinson. 
                More specifically, we sought to analyze the correlation between elision and other factors, such
                as imagery, themes, recipients, and the time period in which the poems were written.</p>
        
            <p>What syntactic and semantic implications are contained in Dickinson's use of ellipsis? 
            Does she tend to use it more or less when writing about a certain topic? Or to a certain person?
            Through our markup and analysis of these poems using XML-based technologies, we were able to generate some
            answers to these questions, and even some new ideas. Explore our website to find out more!</p>
