                <h3>OUR METHODOLOGY</h3>
                <h4>Selecting the markup</h4>
                <p>To begin our mark up, we selected 90 poems from the
                    <a href="https://www.edickinson.org">Emily Dickinson Archive</a> that span her career.  We tried to find
                     a representative sample of poems that feature not only different time periods, but diverse recipients, 
                     types of imagery, and stylistic choices. </p>
                    
                    <p>Dickinson was an active poet between the years 1850-1886. Thus, we divided her 
                    work into early, middle, and late periods as follows:</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Early: </strong>1850-1862</li>
                        <li><strong>Middle: </strong>1863-1874</li>
                        <li><strong>Late: </strong>1875-1886</li>
                    </ul>
               
                <h4>Imagery markup</h4>
                    <p>Our group discussed some of the common themes shown in Dickinson's work, such as 
                        nature, religion, writing, and emotion. We incorporated these themes into our schema
                    and tagged any instances of them that we noticed in the poems.</p>
                
                <h4>Elision markup</h4>
                    <p>Elision was categorized as nominal, verbal, or clausal.</p>
