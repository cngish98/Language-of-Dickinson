        <h1>Potential Dickinson poems for markdown</h1>
        
        <p>Note: I selected the editions mostly based on which one I thought most obviously displayed a poem's elision.</p> 
        <p>The Johnson edition tended to have more annotations or notes on what would have been elided, so I chose those if I saw them. </p>
        <p>Otherwise, I selected based on readability, which usually correlated with the Franklin edition. </p> <br/>
