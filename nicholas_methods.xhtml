        <h1>Methods of Markup for the Emily Dickinson Elision Project</h1>
        
        <h3>Selecting the Poems</h3>
        
        <p>To begin our mark up, we selected 90 poems from Emily Dickinson's corpus that span the early, middle, <br/> 
            and late periods of her career. We determined these periods by selecting spans of several years at a <br/>
            time that we felt were significant time periods in her career. The early period spans from 1850-1862, <br/>
            the middle period spans from 1863-1874, and the late period spans from 1875-1886. The link to the <br/>
            database we used to gather our resources is included below</p>

        <h3>Imagery Markup</h3>
        <p>In order to mark up the imagery we felt was significant in the poems we selected, Rachel began by <br/>
            creating a Relax NG schema that included a myriad of adjectives and nouns we felt were worth marking <br/>
            up. I wont include them all here, but certainly some of the most prevalent examples of imagery we <br/>
            noticed had to do with nature, religion, and animals. Given are restrictive schema, we felt that by <br/>
            marking up portions of text that made reference to things of that nature, we have gathered a cohesive <br/>
            catalogue of imagery-based mark up.</p>
