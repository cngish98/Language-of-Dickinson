<!-- 
Now I knew I lost her -
Not that she was gone -
But Remoteness travelled
On her Face and Tongue.

Alien, though adjoining
As a Foreign Race -
Traversed she though pausing
Latitudeless Place.

Elements Unaltered -
Universe the same
But Love's transmigration -
Somehow this had come -

Henceforth to remember
Nature took the Day
I had paid so much for -
His is Penury
Not who toils for Freedom
Or for Family
But the Restitution
Of Idolatry.
