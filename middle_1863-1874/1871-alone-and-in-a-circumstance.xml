<!--I saw some interpretations that she is talking about writing and feeling like she has been robbed
    the space in which she normally writes. Writing is not really explicitly mentioned though so I have not tagged
    anything as writing -->
<!-- 
Alone and  of in a Circumstance
Reluctant to be told
A spider on my reticence
 deliberately  determinately  impertinently Assiduously crawled

And so much more at Home than I
Immediately grew
I felt myself  the a visitor
And  hastily hurriedly withdrew

Revisiting my late abode
With articles of claim
I found it quietly assumed
 for As a Gymnasium
Where Tax asleep and Title off
The  Peasants inmates of the Air
Perpetual  complacence presumption took
As each were  lawful  only special Heir -
If any strike me on the street
I can return the Blow -
If any  seize take my property
According to the Law
The Statute is my Learned friend
But what redress can be
For an offense nor here nor there
So not in Equity -
That Larceny of time and mind
The marrow of the Day
By spider, or forbid it Lord
That I should specify.
