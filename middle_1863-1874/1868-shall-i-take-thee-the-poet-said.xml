<!-- 
Shall I take thee, the Poet said
To the propounded word?
Be stationed with the Candidates
Till I have  vainer  further finer tried -

The Poet  probed searched Philology
And  when  just was about to ring
for the suspended Candidate
 Advanced There came unsummoned in -

That portion of the Vision
The Word applied to fill
Not unto nomination
The Cherubim reveal -
-->
