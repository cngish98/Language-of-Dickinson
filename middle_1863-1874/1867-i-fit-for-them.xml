<!--An interpretation I saw of this poem is that it is about Dickinson attempting to isolate herself from society in the "Dark"
    in order to be the most "fit" to write poetry, which would serve as "food" for her readers. 
    Even if she does not "succeed," her "aim" to isolate herself is still a reason for celebration.
    This poem is very abstract, but I bet the markdown could be better! -->

<!-- 
I fit for them -
I seek the Dark
Till I am thorough fit.
The labor is a sober one
With the austerer sweet - an - this -
With this sufficient sweet

That abstinence of  me mine produce
A purer food for them, if I succeed,
If not I had
The transport of the Aim -
-->
