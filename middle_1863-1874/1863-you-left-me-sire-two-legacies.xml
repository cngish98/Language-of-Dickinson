            <!--had some trouble figuring out what this poem might be about and who the "sire" is.
            Some interpretations I looked up said it was God, some said it might have been a friend or 
            romantic partner, or about the loss of a child. 
            Not sure how much the authorial intent matters, but the abstractions and elisions in this poem also made it 
            a little difficult to mark up. @Caroline and Wyatt, feel free to expand on what I have here-->
