<!-- 
Because that
you are going
And never
coming back -
And I, however
absolute
May overlook
your track,

Because that
Death is final
However first
it be
This instant
be suspended
Above Mortality

Significance that
each has lived
The other to
detect
Discovery not
God himself
Could now
annihilate -

Eternity, Presump -Presumption
tion
The instant
I perceive
That you, who
were Existence
Yourself forgot
to live -


The "Life that
is" will then
have been
A Thing I
never knew
As Paradise
fictitoiusfictitious
Until the Realm
of you -

The "Life that
is to be" to me
A Residence
too plain
Unless in my
Redeemer's face
I recognize
your own -

Of Immortality
who doubts
He may
exchange with
me
Curtailed by
your obscuring
face
Of Everything
but he

Of Heaven
and Hell
I also yield

The Right to
reprehend
To whoso
would commute
this Face
For his less
priceless Friend.

If "God is
Love" as he
admits
We think that
he must be
Because he is
a "jealous God"
He tells us
certainly


If "All is possible
with" him
As he besides
concedes
He will refund
us finally
Our confiscated
Gods -
