<!--My understanding (after looking up other people's interpretations of this poem too) is that 
    this is a metaphor linking writing by poets to lamps - the influence of poems and ideas (wicks) lasts throughout many "ages",
    even after the lamp "goes out" and the poet dies -->

<!-- 
The Poets light but Lamps -
Themselves - go out -
The Wicks they stimulate -
If vital Light

Inhere as do the Suns -
Each Age a Lens
Disseminating their
Circumference -
-->
