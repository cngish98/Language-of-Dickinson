        <stanza> 
            <line>A narrow fellow in the grass</line>
            <line>Occasionally rides;</line>
            <line>You may have met himdid you not?not</line>
            <line>His notice instant is,</line>
            <line>The grass divides as with a comb,</line>
            <line>A spotted shaft is seen,</line>
            <line>And then it closes at your feet,</line>
            <line>And opens further on.</line>
        </stanza>
            
       <stanza> 
            <line>He likes a boggy acre,</line>
            <line>A floor too cool for corn,</line>
            <line>Yet when a boy and barefoot,</line>
            <line>I more than once at noon</line>
            <line>Have passed, I thought, a whip-lashwhip lash ,</line>
            <line>Unbraiding in the sun,</line>
            <line>When stooping to secure it,</line>
            <line>It wrinkled and was gone.</line>
       </stanza>
       
       <stanza> 
            <line>Several of nature's people</line>
            <line>I know, and they know me;</line>
            <line>I feel for them a transport</line>
            <line>Of cordiality.</line>
            <line>Yet never met this fellow,</line>
            <line>Attended or alone,</line>
            <line>Without a tighter breathing,</line>
            <line>And zero at the bone.</line>
        </stanza>
