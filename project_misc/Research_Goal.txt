Mission Statement

Original Statement:

Our research group has set out to explore innovative linguistic features of Emily Dickinson's poetry. We will mainly track 
her stylistic utilization of ellipsis for its syntactic and semantic implications. 

Additional Criteria:

To narrow down the specific facets of her poetic content that we will focus on, we have chosen to look mostly at poems that 
were addressed to another person. Additionally, we aim to focus on elision in her poems, an interesting linguistic facet to 
mark up since what we will be marking for is actually the exclusion of a grammatical element that was once there. Our mission
statement may be a working document going forward, as Caroline disusses with David and her Linguistics Advisor more detailed
facets of our research
