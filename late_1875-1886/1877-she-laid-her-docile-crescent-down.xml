<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW -->
<!--     
    She laid her docile Crescent down
    And this confiding Stone
    Still states to Dates that have forgot
    The News that she is gone -
    
    So constant to it's stolid trust,
    The Shaft that never knew -
    It shames the Constancy that fled
    Before it's emblem flew - 
-->
