<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW -->
<!--     
    Summer is shorter than any one -
    Life is shorter than Summer -
    Seventy Years is spent as quick
    As an Only Dollar -
    
    Sorrow - now - is polite - and stays -
    See how well we spurn him -
    Equally to abhor Delight -
    Equally retain him - 
-->
