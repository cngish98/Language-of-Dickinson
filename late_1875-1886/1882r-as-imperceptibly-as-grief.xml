    As imperceptibly as Grief
    The Summer lapsed away -
    Too imperceptible at last
    To seem like Perfidy -
    A Quietness distilled
    As Twilight long begun,
    Or Nature spending with herself
    Sequestered Afternoon -
    The Dusk drew earlier in -
    The Morning foreign shone -
    A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,
    As Guest, that would be gone -
    And thus, without a Wing
    Or service of a Keel
    Our Summer made her light escape
    Into the Beautiful.
