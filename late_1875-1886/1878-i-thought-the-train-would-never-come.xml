    I thought the Train would never come -
    How slow the whistle sang -
    I dont believe a peevish Bird
    So whimpered for the Spring -
    I taught my Heart a hundred times
    Precisely what to say -
    Provoking Lover, when you came
    It's Treatise flew away
    To hide my strategy too late
    To wiser  grow be too soon -
    For miseries so halcyon
    The happiness atone -
</body>
