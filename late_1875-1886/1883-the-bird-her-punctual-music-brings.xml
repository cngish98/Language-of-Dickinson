<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW -->
<!--     
    The Bird her punctual music brings
    And lays it in its place -
    It's place is in the Human Heart
    And in the Heavenly Grace -
    What respite from her thrilling toil
    Did Beauty ever take -
    But Work might be electric Rest
    To those that Magic make - 
-->
