<!--     
    A winged spark doth soar about -
    I never met it near
    For Lightning it is oft mistook
    When nights are hot and sere -
    
    It's twinkling Travels it pursues
    Above the Haunts of men -
    A speck of Rapture - first perceived
    By feeling it is gone -
    Rekindled by some action quaint 
-->
