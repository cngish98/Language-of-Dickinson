<!--     
    My country need not change her gown,
    Her triple suit as sweet
    As when 'twas cut at Lexington,
    And first pronounced "a fit."
    
    Great Britain disapproves, "the stars";
    Disparagement discreet, -
    There's something in their attitude
    That taunts her bayonet. 
-->
