<!--POST PLAIN TEXT OF POEM BELOW -->
<!--     
    Go not too near a House of Rose -
    The depredation of a Breeze
    Or inundation of a Dew
    Alarm it's walls away -
    Nor try to tie the Butterfly,
    Nor climb the Bars of Ecstasy, 
    In insecurity to lie
    Is Joy's insuring quality.
-->
