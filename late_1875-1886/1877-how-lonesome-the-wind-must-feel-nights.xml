    How lonesome the Wind must feel Nights -
    When People have put out the Lights
    And everything that has an Inn
    Closes his/the shutter and goes in -
    
    How pompous the Wind must feel Noons
    Stepping to incorporeal Tunes
    Correcting errors of the sky
    And clarifying scenery
    
    How mighty the Wind must feel Morns
    Encamping on a thousand dawns
    Espousing each and spurning all
    Then soaring to his  Turret/Temple Tall -
</body>
