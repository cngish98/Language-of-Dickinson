<!--     
    "And with what body do they come?" -
    Then they do come - Rejoice!
    What Door - What Hour - Run - run - My Soul!
    Illuminate the House!
    
    "Body!" Then real - a Face and Eyes -
    To know that it is them! -
    Paul knew the Man that knew the News -
    He passed through Bethlehem -
