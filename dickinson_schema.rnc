# NOTE OTHER POSSIBLE THEMES / IMAGERY FOR MARKUP HERE:  
# we can make emphasis with <em> ? not totally sure
# Include more elements for analyzing linguistic features (syntax, maybe - Caroline this might depend on you) 
# Maybe make some of the attributes for these elements optional, because they could get redundant typing them each time    cng: yeah that could be good
