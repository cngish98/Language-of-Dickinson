# there could be overlap with other elements so i'm leaving it vague for now

# also dickinson talks a lot about like seasons, and so on, not sure if this falls into nature, and if it does, how to include it in markup?

# NOTE OTHER POSSIBLE THEMES / IMAGERY FOR MARKUP HERE:  
     # love, death, memory 
# Include more elements for analyzing linguistic features (syntax, maybe - Caroline this might depend on you) 
# include TEI-inspired elements and attributes for rhyme, meter? idk how much we want to look for this...
# Maybe make some of the attributes for these elements optional, because they could get redundant typing them each time
